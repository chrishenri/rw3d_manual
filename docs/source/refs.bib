   abstract = {The interplay between the spatial variability of the aquifer hydraulic properties, mass transfer due to sub-grid heterogeneity and chemical reactions often complicates reactive transport simulations. It is well documented that hydro-biochemical properties are ubiquitously heterogeneous and that diffusion and slow advection at the sub-grid scale typically leads to the conceptualization of an aquifer as a multi-porosity system. Within this context, chemical reactions taking place in mobile/immobile water regions can be substantially different between each other. This paper presents a particle-based method that can efficiently simulate heterogeneity, network reactions and multi-rate mass transfer. The approach is based on the development of transition probabilities that describe the likelihood that particles belonging to a given species and mobile/immobile domain at a given time will be transformed into another species and mobile/immobile domain afterwards. The joint effect of mass transfer and sequential degradation is shown to be non-trivial. A characteristic rebound of degradation products can be observed. This late rebound of concentrations is not driven by any change in the flow regime (e.g., pumping ceases in the pump-and-treat remediation strategy) but due to the natural interplay between mass transfer and chemical reactions. To illustrate that the method can simultaneously represent mass transfer, spatially varying properties and network reactions without numerical problems, we have simulated the degradation of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in a three-dimensional fully heterogeneous aquifer subjected to rate-limited mass transfer. Two types of degradation modes were considered to compare the effect of an active biofilm with that of clay pods present in the aquifer. Results of the two scenarios display significantly differences. Biofilms that promote the degradation of compounds in an immobile region are shown to significantly enhance degradation, rapidly producing daughter products and less tailing.},

@article{Benson2017,
   abstract = {When laboratory-measured chemical reaction rates are used in simulations at the field-scale, the models typically overpredict the apparent reaction rates. The discrepancy is primarily due to poorer mixing of chemically distinct waters at the larger scale. As a result, realistic field-scale predictions require accurate simulation of the degree of mixing between fluids. The Lagrangian particle-tracking (PT) method is a now-standard way to simulate the transport of conservative or sorbing solutes. The method's main advantage is the absence of numerical dispersion (and its artificial mixing) when simulating advection. New algorithms allow particles of different species to interact in nonlinear (e.g., bimolecular) reactions. Therefore, the PT methods hold a promise of more accurate field-scale simulation of reactive transport because they eliminate the masking effects of spurious mixing due to advection errors inherent in grid-based methods. A hypothetical field-scale reaction scenario is constructed and run in PT and Eulerian (finite-volume/finite-difference) simulators. Grid-based advection schemes considered here include 1st- to 3rd-order spatially accurate total-variation-diminishing flux-limiting schemes, both of which are widely used in current transport/reaction codes. A homogeneous velocity field in which the Courant number is everywhere unity, so that the chosen Eulerian methods incur no error when simulating advection, shows that both the Eulerian and PT methods can achieve convergence in the L1 (integrated concentration) norm, but neither shows stricter pointwise convergence. In this specific case with a constant dispersion coefficient and bimolecular reaction A+B→P, the correct total amount of product is 0.221MA0, where MA0 is the original mass of reactant A. When the Courant number drops, the grid-based simulations can show remarkable errors due to spurious over- and under-mixing. In a heterogeneous velocity field (keeping the same constant and isotropic dispersion), the PT simulations show an increased reaction total from 0.221MA0 to 0.372MA0 due to fluid deformation, while the 1st-order Eulerian simulations using ≈ 106 cells (with a classical grid Peclet number Δx/αL of 10) have total product of 0.53MA0, or approximately twice as much additional reaction due to advection error. The 3rd-order TVD algorithm fares better, with total product of 0.394MA0, or about 1.14 times the increased reaction total. A very strict requirement on grid Peclet numbers for Eulerian simulations will be required for realistic reactions because of their nonlinear nature. We analytically estimate the magnitude of the effect for the end-member cases of very fast and very slow reactions and show that in either case, the mass produced is proportional to 1/Pe, where Pe is the Peclet number. Therefore, extra mass is produced according to D, where the dispersion includes any numerical dispersion error. We test two PT methods, one that kills particles upon reaction and another that decrements a particle's mass. For the bimolecular reaction studied here, the computational demands of the particle-killing methods are much smaller than, and the particle-number-preserving algorithm are on par with, the fastest Eulerian methods.},

   abstract = {<p>The complexity of mass transfer processes often complicates solute transport simulations. We present a new approach for the implementation of the multirate mass transfer model into random walk particle tracking. This novel method allows for a spatially heterogeneous distribution of mass transfer coefficients as well as hydrodynamic parameters in three dimensions, and it is well suited for avoiding numerical dispersion and solving computationally demanding transport simulations. For this purpose the normalized zeroth spatial moments of the multirate transport equations are derived and used as phase transition probabilities. Performing a simple Bernoulli trial on the appropriate phase transition probabilities the particle distribution between the mobile domain and any immobile domain can be determined. The approach is compared satisfactorily to analytical and semianalytical solutions for one‐dimensional, advective‐dispersive transport with different types of mass transfer. Aspects of the numerical implementation of this approach are presented, and it is demonstrated that two restrictive criteria for the time step size have to be considered. By adjusting the time step size for each grid cell on the basis of the cell specific velocity field and mass transfer rate a correct simulation of solute transport is assured, while at the same time computational efficiency is preserved. Finally, an example is presented evaluating the effect of a heterogeneous intraparticle pore diffusion in a synthetic aquifer. The results demonstrate that for this specific case the heterogeneous distribution of mass transfer rates does not have a significant influence on mean solute transport behavior but that at low concentration ranges, differences between the different mass transfer models become visible.</p>},

abstract = {ABSTRACT A semianalytical particle tracking method was developed for use with velocities generated from block centered finite-difference ground-water flow models. The method is based on the assumption that each directional velocity component varies linearly within a grid cell in its own coordinate directions. This assumption allows an analytical expression to be obtained describing the flow path within an individual grid cell. Given the initial position of a particle anywhere in a cell, the coordinates of any other point along its path line within the cell, and the time of travel between them, can be computed directly. For steady-state systems, the exit point for a particle entering a cell at any arbitrary location can be computed in a single step. By following the particle as it moves from cell to cell, this method can be used to trace the path of a particle through any multidimensional flow field generated from a block-centered finite-difference flow model.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper addresses two particular problems which arise in particle tracking calculations because of the spatial discretization used in the block-centered finite-difference flow model. These two problems are: (1) the presence of a “weak” sink or source (i.e., a sink or source that does not result in complete inward or outward gradients on all interfaces of the cell containing the sink or source); and (2) the use of a model grid with varying vertical cell dimensions within an individual layer. While these problems can be mitigated by using a sufficiently fine spatial discretization, there are always computational and practical limitations on the number of model nodes. Two procedures are presented in this paper which minimize particle tracking errors associated with weak sinks/sources or vertically distorted grids. The first procedure uses an approximate analytical solution to define the velocity distribution inside a model cell containing a weak sink/source so that the capture of the particles entering the cell can be determined accurately. The second procedure establishes an automatic adjustment of the particle vertical coordinate according to the degree of vertical grid distortion. These procedures are shown to be effective, and improve the accuracy of particle tracking results under nonideal spatial discretizations.},
